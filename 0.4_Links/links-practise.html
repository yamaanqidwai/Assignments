    <h3 id="Creating-Links">Creating Links</h3>
    <p>
      Links are created using the {a} element which has an attribute called
      href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to
      go to when they click on the link. <br />
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Linking to another page</b></dt>
      <dd><br />click {a href="https://xyz.com" target="_blank"} here {/a}</dd>

      <h4>Explanation</h4>
      <!-- used h4 instead of bold to add lines -->
      attribute href is used to make the link clickable and be able to take the
      user to that page(pointed by the link) <br />
      attribute target is used to tell the browser where to open the page <br />
      _blank = open in new tab <br /><br />

      <dt><b>Linking to element on same page </b></dt>
      <dd><br />click {a href="#ID-of-element" target=""} here {/a}</dd>

      <h4>Explanation</h4>
      <!-- used h4 instead of bold to add lines -->
      attribute href is used to make the link clickable and be able to take the
      user to that element(pointed by the link and id allocated to it) <br />
      In order to link to element on same page, give id to that element and use
      #IDname in href <br />
      target could be set to any 4 of the available options. <br />

      <h3>
        Something <em><b>similiar</b></em> could be done to link to specific
        part of another page
      </h3>
      In order to link to element on <em>different</em> page, give id to that
      element and give path to the page and use #IDname in href after giving /
      after the path<br />
      <b>Eg 1:</b> https://xyz.com/#IDname <br />
      <b>Eg 2:</b> ./path/#IDname <br />
      target could be set to any 4 of the available options. <br />

      <dt id="Absolute-URL">
        <h3>Absolute URL:</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own
        URL.<br />
        An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be
        followed by the path to a specific page. <br />
        If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.
      </dd>

      <h3>Example of Absolute URL:</h3>
      Going from current page to another page stored in another directory but on
      the same machine. <br />
      https://./../parent-child/child-page2

      <h4>Explanation of Example</h4>
      ./ = go to current directory. <br />
      ../ = go back one directory /directory-name = go the named directory
    </dl>

    <br />

    <dl>
      <dt id="Relative-URL">
        <h3>Relative URL</h3>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Its path generally refers to a resource on the same machine as the
        current document.
      </dd>
      <h4>Example of Relative URL:</h4>
      https://example.com/parent-page1/child-page1/grandchild
